This repository contains solutions for various programming tasks in Python, focusing on topics like conditional statements, loops, functions, and more. Each task is designed to strengthen your
 understanding of Python programming.


Task Descriptions:


0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
This program assigns a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed.
The source code is completed to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive, zero, or negative.

1. The last digit
This program assigns a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed.
The source code is completed to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number and provide additional information based on its value.

2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
This program prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
Only one print function with string format and one loop are allowed, and no characters should be stored in a variable.

3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
This program prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e'.
Only one print function with string format and one loop are allowed, and no characters should be stored in a variable.

4. Hexadecimal printing
This program prints numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal.
Only one print function with string format and one loop are allowed, and no numbers or strings should be stored in a variable.

5. 00...99
This program prints numbers from 0 to 99 in ascending order, separated by commas and spaces.
No more than two print functions with string format and only one loop are allowed, and no numbers or strings should be stored in a variable.

6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need
This program prints all possible different combinations of two digits in ascending order.
No more than three print functions with string format and no more than two loops are allowed, and no numbers or strings should be stored in a variable.

7. islower
A function islower(c) is implemented, which checks if a character is lowercase.
No module imports, and no use of str.upper() or str.isupper() is allowed.

8. To uppercase
A function uppercase(str) is implemented, which prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.
No more than two print functions with string format and only one loop are allowed, and no module imports or use of str.upper() or str.isupper() is allowed.

9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
A function print_last_digit(number) is implemented, which prints the last digit of a number.
No module imports are allowed.

10. a + b
A function add(a, b) is implemented, which adds two integers and returns the result.
No module imports are allowed.

11. a ^ b
A function pow(a, b) is implemented, which computes a to the power of b and returns the value.
No module imports are allowed.

12. Fizz Buzz
A function fizzbuzz() is implemented, which prints numbers from 1 to 100 with specific rules.
No module imports are allowed.

13. Insert in sorted linked list
A function insert_node(head, number) is implemented, which inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.
No module imports are allowed.

14. Smile in the mirror
This program prints the ASCII alphabet in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase, not followed by a new line.
Only one print function with string format and one loop are allowed, and no characters should be stored in a variable.

15. Remove at position
A function remove_char_at(str, n) is implemented, which creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n.
No module imports are allowed.

16. ByteCode -> Python #2
A Python function magic_calculation(a, b, c) is implemented to mimic the behavior of a provided Python bytecode.
No module imports are allowed.
